This is a personal project aimed at experimenting with [CycleGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593).

It recreates an image to resemble a hand-drawn sketch using a pencil.

To try it out, you can use the following command:

```bash
$ python3 deployment.py <image_file>

Requirements:

Tensorflow 1.14 (Compatible with versions below 2.0 and supporting eager execution)

OpenCV

Results can be observed in the results folder.

Please note that this project is intended for personal experimentation and educational purposes.
